          <div class="cell-3 text">I was born and raised in Mexico. I've always loved computers but unfortunatelly I was told
          that a computer science career was not a good fit for me. I believed that for a while and took a different direction.
          It took me some years to realize that I can be whatever I want to be and I can dream whatever I want to and 
          pursuit whatever dream I have.</div>

          show them that no matter how big or difficult our dreams might look, it is worth it always fight for accomplish
          them. </div>
